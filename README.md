### Purpose
  This Sinatra App serves as a homepage for a make-believe online community college. The college allows users to create accounts for whether they are a student or an instructor. Students and instructors have various features they can both do. You can read more about this project on my blog at [Sinatra Portfolio Projet](http://johnfelixespinosa.github.io/).

### Features

  * CRUD for user created objects  

  | Students          | Instructor    |
  | -------------     |:-------------:| 
  | Can search available courses    | CRUD courses  |
  | Can Enroll and withdraw from courses |

  ##### Courses
    * Courses can be created by Instructors
    * Attributes include course_name, course_instuctor(user[:username]), course_credits
    * Courses can be edited by instructors

  ##### Enrollments
    * Students can enroll in a course which creates a new Enrollment object
    * An Enrollment object contains user_id and course_id
    * An Enrollment object can be deleted, effectively withdrawing the student from the course
    * An enrollment object cannot be duplicated due to the already_enrolled? method
